Thanks to [Alexander Pravdin](https://github.com/speller) for the original idea in [this comment](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1512).
Since we moved all our build-processes to [depot](https://depot.dev), we don't need this anymore and have much faster and more reliable multi-arch builds.

Please see https://github.com/reproducible-containers/buildkit-cache-dance for a maintained copy of this repo.
